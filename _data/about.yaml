Course Description: >
  Understanding design principles to engineer biological systems. 
  Emphasis on genetic circuits, transcriptional regulation, metabolic engineering, and genome engineering. 
  Material will also cover applications of recent biotechnological/synthetic biology advances.

Learning Objectives: >
  Systems and synthetic biology focus on defining the parts and principles governing biological systems. 
  By taking this class, you will learn how design principles apply to biological systems. 
  Specifically, you will be able to explain:
    1. Concepts of genetic circuits and gene regulation

    2. Challenges and applications of metabolic engineering 
    
    3. Design principles in engineering cellular systems
    
    4. Technologies that enable metabolic and genome engineering

Grading: >
  There will be weekly homework assignments, two labs, and a final project over the course of the quarter. 
  Students will be required to submit lab writeups. The final project will both consist of a written and presentation portion. 
  Final project topic must be confirmed by Professor Shih by Week 7, and students will be expected to work with the TA early on to draft up topic ideas. 
  
  
  Grade Weighting:
  
  * Homework: 25%
  
  * Lab 1 writeup: 25%
  
  * Lab 2 writeup: 25%
  
  * Final project: 25% (PowerPoint presentation and written report)
